Installing Bake
---------------

Bake is a build system orchestration tool that was primarily designed for installing ns-3
`Direct Code Execution <https://ns-3-dce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html>`_ but
can be used more generally to install ns-3 third-party libraries and apps.

Bake is a Python 3 program that requires the ``distro`` and ``requests`` packages; to start
using Bake, it is generally sufficient to add those packages to your Python 3 installation
using ``pip``.

Bake is further documented elsewhere, including
`here <https://www.nsnam.org/docs/bake/tutorial/html/index.html>`_ and in the
`Getting Started <https://www.nsnam.org/docs/tutorial/html/getting-started.html#downloading-ns-3-using-bake>`_ chapter of the |ns3| tutorial.
